<h3>Informed consent</h3>
<p>Canopy Medical provides Gender-Affirming Hormone Therapy using the informed consent model.  This means that you do not need to see a therapist before seeking out care. The informed consent model for gender-affirming treatment seeks to better support your right to personal autonomy and encourages shared decision making between yourself and your provider.</p>
<p>An initial informed consent visit will take approximately 1 hour. All risks and benefits of hormones will be explained to you and you will have ample time to ask questions. A thorough health history and exam is also completed.</p>
<p>Once hormone therapy has been started, check-up visits occur every 3 months for the first year. Visits can then be spread out to monitor your transition.</p>
